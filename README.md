# VHDL_LogicalEquationSim
A simple program written in VHDL used to simulate/solve the outputs of two separate logical equations both in SOP and POS simultaneously. The program also utilizes a different architectural design type for each function. (DataFlow and Behavorial Arch types)
The following functions were used for the program: F1 = W'X'Z'+W'XZ+WYZ'+WXY' (SOP)  | F2 = (W+Z')(W'+X'+Y)(W'+X+Y'+Z) (POS)
The code was written in VHDL using ModelSim Altera.
